    The Dragunov SVD is a Soviet-designed, semi-automatic sniper rifle chambered in 7.62x54mmR, developed in the 1960s for the Soviet Army. It is known for its ruggedness, reliability, and semi-automatic action, which allows for faster follow-up shots than a bolt-action rifle. The SVD is used by many military forces worldwide and is effective at medium-range, with a practical range of up to 800 meters and beyond.
